# Fonts

Free font families that are not installed by default on macOS but that I use for various projects.

## Font families

| Font family                  | Source                                  | Usage       |

## Installation

To install a specific font family, proceed as follows:

1. _Font Book > File > Add Fonts to Current User..._
2. Select the directory containing the `.tff` files, and click _Open_

The font family is now installed on the system and can be used by any application.
